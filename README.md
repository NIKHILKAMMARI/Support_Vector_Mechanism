# Support_Vector_Mechanism
Using support vector mechanism algorithm odf supervised machin learning, predict iris.csv data set to find out spieces will the smae or different

# TASK 1 
Preprocess the data in a skit learn library
# TASK 2
Load the data using sklearn model selection default argument 
# TASK 3
On the basis of your data set train test and split SVM model
# TASK 4
Implement support vector mechanism classifier svm_classifier. the svm must be "Leaner" 
# TASK 5
Train the classifer on the training data 
# TASK 6
Find out the prediction value on the test data
# TASK 7
Test the model with the help of accuracy, accuracy should be lie  in the range o to 1

 # CONCLUSION
According to my support vector machanism model the species are Linear with the accuracy of 1.00. hence proved model was sucessfully implement
